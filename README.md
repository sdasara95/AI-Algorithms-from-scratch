# AI-Algorithms-from-scratch
Implementation of various ML/AI/CS algorithms from scratch for various real-world use cases.

This repository contains three sub-folders of from scratch implementations:
* Bagging-Boosting contains kNN, Random Forest, Adaboost to classify image orientation angle.
* POS contains MCMC, HMM Viterbi and Naive Bayes to classify parts of speech for each word in the sentence.
* Shortest path contains A* search, BFS, DFS, IDS implementations to find shortest route between two cities.
